						<h1>Paula Bramwell</h1>
						<h2>Clinical Psychologist | <span>BA (Hons) MPsych (Clinical)</span></h2>
						<p>I am a registered clinical psychologist and am committed to the provision of excellence in psychological care for adolescents, adults, individuals, couples and families. I am able to work closely with you to develop trust in a warm therapeutic relationship to allow you to explore and resolve your concerns.</p>
						<p>I have extensive training and clinical experience in the treatment of a broad range of psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, anger, interpersonal difficulties, relationship troubles, family conflict, parenting struggles, shyness, panic attacks, phobias, worries, obsessive compulsive disorder, trauma and post traumatic stress disorder, organisation and hoarding, stress, grief, addictions, self-harm, personality disorders, assertiveness, communication and low self-esteem.</p>
						<p>I am registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency as a clinical psychologist and am able to provide therapy services under the Medicare Better Access Scheme or private health insurance. This means that if eligible, and with a GP/psychiatrist/paediatrician referral you are able to receive Medicare rebates for up to 10 sessions per year. Individual private health funds vary so check with your provider.</p>
						<h2>My approach</h2>
						<p>It is through warmth, understanding and empathy that I will work together with you to help you to heal. There is extensive research that shows that the most important factor in achieving positive outcomes in therapy is the relationship between the therapist and client. The most effective therapists achieve the best outcomes because they are willing to hear about how their clients experience them. I will invite feedback from you to improve the way we work together and to provide a space where you can safely explore and understand difficult experiences. The particular approach selected in your therapy depends upon the nature of your concern and any preference you may have for one approach over another. I often find an individually-tailored blend of approaches is most helpful for people. I draw from evidence-based techniques that I have specialist training and experience with including Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), interpersonal therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), systemic therapy, family therapy and attachment-based therapy.</p>
						<h2>Making an appointment</h2>
						<p>I am currently accepting new referrals. To enquire or to make an appointment, please <a href="tel:0439432224">call</a> or <a href="mailto:paula@paulabramwell.com.au">email</a>.</p>
